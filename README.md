The CSS styles in this portfolio are used to organize the layout, improve visual appeal, and make the project easy to understand and use. Flexbox and Grid help structure sections like the header, projects, and skills in a clean and consistent way. A simple color scheme is applied to maintain a professional look, while contrasting colors highlight important elements such as headings and buttons. Typography styles define clear differences between headings and body text, improving readability and visual hierarchy. Spacing through margins and padding keeps content balanced and uncluttered. Media queries ensure the portfolio is responsive across different screen sizes, and subtle hover effects add interactivity without distraction. Overall, the CSS enhances usability, clarity, and presentation of the project.
